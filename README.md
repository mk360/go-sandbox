### Goals

Learn Go while having fun.

### Experience with Go

One little proprietary application. Nothing fancy.

### What to expect

Random commits touching on random ideas or experiments I'm inspired to run. Might or might not evolve into something useful someday.

### Where to track these ideas

I'll do my best to list them here.

### Ideas touched upon so far

- Grasp the language basics again
- Split the main module into packages
- Public and private functions
- How to express a function's return type, declaring vs initializing a variable, remembering that we can return more than one value (and usually it's an error)
- First HTTP GET request, first struct
- `p o i n t e r s`
- What happens if I dereference a referenced pointer? (like `int something = *&otherthing`)
- What happens if I initialize a struct through a pointer to another struct, then mess with both of them separately?
- What happens if I fetch a floating-point value from an API (like, seriously, any API that returns a float) and assign it to an int? (current experiment)
